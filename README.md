# Predicting Employee Attrition: A Machine Learning Approach
During this project, I focused on predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques with a dataset of 1471 employees. The research involved meticulous data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to explore the relationships between various factors and employee turnover, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used to highlight key predictors and simplify the dataset.

Neural network models were employed to forecast attrition based on features such as job satisfaction and performance metrics. Additionally, a Multilayer Perceptron Classifier was utilized through PySpark for efficient processing. The findings from this analysis aim to inform better employee retention strategies by identifying significant predictors of attrition and offering insights into improving workplace practices.
